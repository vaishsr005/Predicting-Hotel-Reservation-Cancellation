The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a customer will honor their hotel reservation or cancel it. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to identify the factors that influence reservation cancellations. This predictive model will enable hotel owners to proactively manage their resources, optimize revenue management strategies, and enhance customer service by better understanding customer booking behavior. Simulated the app on Streamlit to view the predictions.
